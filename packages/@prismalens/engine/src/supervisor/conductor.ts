 * Conduct one investigation: drive the supervisor stream, fan every canonical

 * terminal outcome. Two ports vary across runtimes; the drive-loop + lifecycle
 * ordering are owned here ONCE (architecture-review candidate #2 — the drive-loop
 * was otherwise hand-rolled in each consumer):
 *
 *   - SINK  (live/ephemeral) — every canonical event as it streams:
 *       CLI `investigate` → a terminal timeline line
 *       CLI `serve`       → a JSON-RPC `investigate/event` notification
 *       web worker        → publish to the Redis stream channel (→ SSE → UI)
 *       standalone        → append to the `~/.prismalens` events file
 *   - STORE (durable lifecycle) — create → append(per event) → finish|fail:
 *       CLI  → sessions.create → appendEvent → writeReport+done | update(errored)
 *       worker → status(running)+timeline(started) → NO-OP append →
 *                writeResult+timeline(completed) | status(failed)+timeline(failed)
 *
 * The engine stays db/env-clean (ADR-0011): the caller supplies a {@link
 * InvestigationStore} adapter, and `conductRun` owns the create→append→finish/fail
 * ordering. The report-capture lives HERE (the terminal `report` event), not in the
 * sink. The no-evidence guard lives in {@link investigateIncidentStream} — it emits
 * no `report` event when a branch gathered nothing, so `report` stays null here and
 * we resolve `store.fail` instead of laundering a fabricated report.
